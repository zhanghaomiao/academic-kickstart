  I'm a PhD in biophysics from the Huazhong University of Science and Technoly. By combing the machine learning and molecuar dynamics, my subject focus on the conformation change of protein . For the sampling protein is diffcult, I develop a method which could accerlate the configuraiton sampling and apply it to study the configuration change of RNA or protein by using machine-realted method.

  In my spare time, I learn a lot about computer, such as the algorithm, operating system and computer network, parallel computing. I'm interested in programming and had developed the software for my projects.
